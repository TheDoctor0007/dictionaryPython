# dictionaryPython
Dictionary in Python in which you can insert, delete, or search for numbers.

Positions where numbers have been deleted will have value 0. Positions between the min and max where a number could exist but is not yet set will also have value 0. The length of the dictionary will be the maximum inserted value even after it is deleted.
